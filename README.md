# Python & NumPy Foundations for Neural Networks

This repository documents my deliberate practice of **Python and NumPy fundamentals**
with the specific goal of building **neural networks from scratch** later on.

Rather than jumping into frameworks, the focus here is on developing
a strong mental model of:
- data structures
- tensor shapes
- vectorized computation
- numerical operations

so that implementation details never become a bottleneck.

## Current Status

###  Python
- Core Python syntax and semantics
- Control flow, functions, modules
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets
- Basic file handling and scripting
- Comfortable writing clean, readable Python code

Python is **largely complete** for my current needs and will be refined further only when required by projects.

###  NumPy
Completed a full NumPy fundamentals notebook covering:
- ndarray basics
- Shape, ndim, dtype
- Array creation methods
- Indexing and slicing
- Reshape, flatten, transpose
- Broadcasting
- Elementwise vs matrix operations
- Reductions and axes
- keepdims usage
- Universal functions (ufuncs)
- Copy vs view semantics
- Vectorization mindset

This level is sufficient to implement forward and backward passes
without relying on external deep learning libraries.

## Next Steps

- Solve Deep Learning Specialization assignments of NumPy
- Translate mathematical equations into correct tensor operations
- Gradually move toward implementing neural networks from scratch
